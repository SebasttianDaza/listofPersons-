# __Aplicattion the list of persons and Data__ 🖥️🖥️🏴

Application developed with JS, HTML, CSS, used to practice in my beginnings in the world of programming, as one of my first projects.

I consider it very important and I have uploaded it to GitHub, not because it is a big project, but because it shows me the progress I have made.

The project was developed in the course of the JavaScript University course found on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/universidad-javascript-angular-react-vue-typescript-html-css-bootstrap/).An excellent course totally recommended
